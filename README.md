# An example of an essay I have written

I left school and went to study Civil Engineering at university, but I
never quite took to it. I would follow along, crushing concrete in labs
and scrawling notes in dusty lecture theatres, with grumpy Russian
professors racing along and mumbling “the proof is simple, left for the
student” under their breath. Somehow I never thought it was that
simple, but in the end I managed to pass my exams before moving on
to study something else.
Whilst my maths is a little bit shaky now, some of the more surprising
lessons from engineering stuck with me. I learnt that engineers often
don’t understand structures they are designing very well, and they often
don’t try too. It was reassuring to learn that it wasn’t just me who gave
up on problems because they were too hard. Fully qualified engineers,
who had passed all their exams, do the same.
Instead engineers solve simplified problems. For example, understanding
how all of the forces in a concrete slab floor interact is too complicated
to calculate. Instead engineers assume forces can only move in certain
directions, which makes the calculations manageable and underestimates
the strength of the floor. This doesn’t lead to disaster though, instead it

gives engineers a safety margin. Overestimating strength could be
catastrophic, underestimating isn’t a problem.
Engineers can do this because they understand their assumptions. They
can intelligently decide how and when to simplify a problem, and they
aren’t at risk of catastrophe.
Knowing this caused me issues in my studies later on. I changed
courses to study economics and this kind of pedantry wasn’t
appreciated. Here assumptions were glossed over and I got into strange
conversations with professors. “Well, the theory needs it to work so
that’s why we assume those things” my professors would say. “Really?” I
would reply.
I wasn’t alone, other voices like Professor Steve Keen, a research fellow
at UCL, would point out similar issues. For instance most ideas in
economics depend up “reaching equilibrium points”, though these never
seem to occur in reality. In the 1800s and before computers, economists
assumed equilibrium to make the sums work. Physicists of the time
faced similar problems, but once computers arrived they invented Chaos
theory to understand dynamic systems. Very few economists realise
these mistakes and continue forward with dangerous flaws in their
thinking.

One such mistake is ubiquitous across all of our political parties, and it
impacts every level of decision making. Economists and MP’s talk
endlessly about free trade. If we could just sign enough free trade
agreements… GDP goes up therefore our problems are solved.
The trouble is theories about free trade and economic growth depend
on something known as “comparative advantage” which goes something
like this. The French produce amazing foods, the best cheeses and
exquisite wines. The Germans on the other hand, their real talent lies in
engineering and manufacturing. Everyone would be best off if the
French focused on making fantastic foods and the German’s made all
the cars and machinery. This would maximise “Economic Value”.
It was the theory of comparative advantage which drove Margaret
Thatcher to close down our industrial base and set us up for foreign
companies closing down towns like Grangemouth. Mines, Shipyards,
Manufacturing and refinement - all gone. And it’s why our politicians
don’t seem to mind if AI, Electric Vehicles, Bio-tech, microchips and
solar panels are made elsewhere. All the industries which will decide
the future of the world are developed, or made profitable abroad, a
natural consequence of this thinking.

The theory of comparative advantage came about in the early 1800s, a
world very different from today. This was before aeroplanes, the internet
and international tax havens. Before you could move money abroad at
the touch of a button and serious levels of immigration were impossible.
The Libertarian Ludwig Von-Mises, of the Austrian school of economics
and proponent total free-markets, pointed out the faulty assumptions of
comparative advantage in the 1950’s, though no one seemed noticed. In
his book “Human Action” Mises says “in a world where there is free
trade, and free movement of money and labour, some areas would be
abandoned, becoming as uninhabited as the polar regions”. Cold,
desolate and barren. To any of you who grew up, like me, in and
around Britain’s old industrial heartlands, I wonder if this statement
strikes chord?
Now this isn’t a call for socialism, or communism – often an economic
catastrophe. This isn’t a call to an end of free trade either, or a call to
end all immigration, or to make moving money out of the country
illegal. These questions are all political and for everyone to come to
their own decisions about.
Instead it’s to argue that we need to spend more time understanding
and interrogating our assumptions. When we are making decisions,

about anything, not just bridges or the economy, we can be led astray.
Just because something worked in a previous era doesn’t mean it will in
the future. We need to understand fully the models we work from. What
assumptions do they make? Are these assumptions still true? Which
things are uncertain? It is only through this interrogation of our
thinking, being honest, clarifying what we don’t know, and
understanding the limits of our calculations can we
